1. Backend:
   1. Log all queries?
   2. Why always cors error when internal error happens?
   3. Test keyword values (can we get some good scores out of it?)
   4. empty vocabulary; perhaps the documents only contain stop words (for summarize)
   5. Check for empty `preprocessed_text`
   6. Turn off threading or host separate api for the models?
   7. Rate limits
   8. Upload new models (indexes and mongodb) - retry everything just to make sure everything works

2. Frontend:
   1. Mobile check
   2. Cosmetic changes frontend
   3. Rate limits warnings
   4. Black/flake -like things for tsx
   5. Footer at the bottom

3. Code quality:
   1. Cleanup TODOs
   2. Cleanup github
   3. Tests?

4. For presentation:
   1. Add info about rate limiting
   2. Fill in text
   3. Prepare example queries
