1. Backend:
   1. Upload new models (indexes and mongodb) - retry everything just to make sure everything works
   2. Log all queries?
   3. Test keyword values (can we get some good scores out of it?)
   4. Fix `encoded_processed_text` (Check for empty `preprocessed_text`) -- real empty pages
   5. empty vocabulary; perhaps the documents only contain stop words (for summarize) -- real empty pages

2. Frontend:
   1. Black/flake -like things for tsx
   3. Cosmetic changes frontend

3. Code quality:
   1. Cleanup TODOs
   2. Cleanup github
   3. Tests?

4. For presentation (page info):
   1. Prepare example queries
   2. Include GitHub page
