1. Backend:
   1. Upload new models (indexes and mongodb)
   2. Why always cors error when internal error happens?
   3. Log all queries?
   4. Test keyword values (can we get some good scores out of it?)
   5. empty vocabulary; perhaps the documents only contain stop words (for summarize)
   6. Check for empty `preprocessed_text`
   7. Turn off threading or host separate api for the models?
   8. Rate limits


2. Frontend:
   1. Loading circle
   2. Cancel previous calls
   3. Display errors
   4. Mobile check   
   5. Ensure frontend has validation for fields (need to be provided) 
   6. Cosmetic changes frontend
   7. Rate limits warnings
   8. Black/flake -like things for tsx
   9. Footer at the bottom

3. Code quality:
   1. Cleanup TODOs
   2. Cleanup github
   3. Tests?

4. For presentation:
   1. Add info about rate limiting
   2. Fill in text
   3. Prepare example queries
